# Networking-Fundamentals-I-II
These assignments overview the fundamental topics of cybersecurity and computer Networking. These also review more advanced concepts such as DHCP, NAT, routing, wireless technology, DNS records, and email networking.

Homework 8

The Scenario for this assignment was as follows:

In this unit, we will focus on one of the most important foundational topics in cybersecurity, computer networking. Understanding how systems and devices are networked together to exchange information is a vital skill for cybersecurity professionals.

•	The first day will cover the client/server model, network topologies, and how IP addresses and DNS are used to connect systems together.

•	The second day will cover additional foundational topics such as ports, protocols, and the OSI model. We will then use a networking tool called Wireshark to visualize and analyze networking concepts.

•	The third day will dive deeper into OSI layers 2, 3, and 4. We will learn tools and protocols related to each layer, and perform a SYN scan to search for open ports on a network.



Steps used to complete task:
1.	I used fping against the IP ranges to determine the IP’s for the Hollywood office.
2.	I used SYN SCAN against the IP accepting connections.
3.	I logged into the RockStar server from the previous step using username: jimi and password: hendrix, to determine if something was modified on this system that might affect viewing rollingstone.com within the browser. 
4.	I found where the hacker left a note as to where he stored away some packet captures.
5.	I used Wireshark to analyze this pcap file and determine if there was any suspicious activity that could be attributed to a hacker.




Homework 9

In the second networking fundamentals unit, I built on the skills learned in the first week, covering more advanced concepts such as DHCP, NAT, routing, wireless technology, DNS records, and email networking. The week concludes with a fun Capture the Flag competition that uses the skills learned in both weeks.
